Hi there, I'm Ashish Pant! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate Data Analyst with a strong background in Python programming and machine learning. I'm enthusiastic about solving complex problems through data-driven insights and creating innovative solutions.

About Me

ðŸŒ± I hold a Data Analysis certification and a Machine Learning in Python certification from DataQuest.
ðŸ“Š My expertise lies in data analysis, machine learning, and neural networks.
ðŸ”¬ I'm constantly exploring new techniques and tools in the field of data science.
ðŸŽ“ I'm eager to collaborate on projects that involve predictive modeling, data visualization, and algorithm development.

Projects
Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

Customer Churn Prediction Project
Churn Prediction: This project accurately predicts customer churn, providing businesses with valuable insights into customer retention.
Multiple Models: The project supports various machine learning models, allowing businesses to choose the best-fit model for their data.
Data Preprocessing: The project includes data preprocessing steps to ensure the data is ready for model training.
Visualization: Visualize the project's results and gain a deeper understanding of customer churn patterns.
ClassifyIt: A Versatile Machine Learning Prediction App (Classification)

Predicting Heart Disease(Logistic Regression): 
â€¢	Technology:  This project aims to predict the likelihood of a patient having heart disease in the future. By analyzing the dataset and building a predictive model, 
            we can identify risk factors associated with heart disease and potentially prevent                          t           Premature deaths.
â€¢	Responsibility:  Machine learning Algorithm
